I sit in the index between key & lock. 
Behind, is the key. 
It holds all the information that I could know, 
Every possibility calculated meticulously-
All just out of reach.
For I am no owl, I fear the dark, 
Fearful of wind-twisted footprints- 
I am a mouse. 
One who hides by a temporary display of light,
Just to hide back in a web of disorder, 
Unable to jump (and face) back out.
/Ahead, is the lock. 
Impenetrable- unwavered by pins, dust and brute force
Yet ever the more necessary to crack and open. 
Chronologically magnetised are key & lock,
Forever opposite, but drawn by a sketch that will become 
An answer (of many) I am seeking. 
The lock is simple, tabula rasa.
Unhindered by entangled engravings enough to blind,
But maybe, 
if I prune the flowers,
And take a step back,
I only need to wait (& see).
